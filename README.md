# glucose

An infant, strongly-typed functional programming language.

## Overview

Glucose can barely be said to have begun development.

It represents an optimistic project to develop a pure, strongly typed functional programming language, very much inspired by Haskell, with the following broad goals:
 * Performance
 * Expressive typing
 * Syntactic brevity

The intention is that development of the language and compiler will proceed incrementally, with tests and documentation maintained along with it.
